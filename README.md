  <h3 align="center">C- Essentials</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This repository contains the most useful functions that I worked on to help me complete projects as the name implies they are very essential and I may not want to go through the stress of brainstorming them again to save time.

## About The Project

This is the most C essential function I worked on in my software engineering program with Holberton School and ALX. I want to create this so that it'll be easy for me or other engineers to access and use it in their projects if the need arises. There are a lot of resources of this kind on here, however, I didn't find it easy looking for them so I'm creating this one to suit my needs.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating efficient and amazing modules. A function that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a function from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more shortly. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo, creating a pull request, or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

## Built With

This section lists the major frameworks that I utilized to build this project. Here are a few examples.

* [C]()
* [Betty Linter]()

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you can make use of this project you need to have the C compiler installed on your local machine and should also be familiar with the Betty Linter.

Type “gcc –version” in the terminal to check whether the C compiler is installed on your machine. Type “g++ –version” in the terminal to check whether the C++ compiler is installed on your machine.
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhokabeatz/C-Essentials.git
```

3. cd into the C-Essentials directory

```sh
cd C-Essentials 
```

4. Open the files with any IDE of your choice

```JS
code . or code <filename>
```

## Usage

I'll show an example of making use of these codes here soon.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/dhokabeatz/C-Essentials/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dhokabeatz/C-Essentials/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes.
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Create individual PR for each suggestion.
* Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/dhokabeatz/C-Essentials/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting your first idea as well.
